          <p>
            I love creating products from ideas, paper, and pencil and Iâ€™ve made
            some digital products. I'm also known as a programmer, digital
            marketer, UX/UI designer, I can do 2D animation as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a technical background and graduated from APTECH APROTRAIN.
            But I also have a passion for colors, images, drawing so my first
            career is about designing, photoshop & convert PSD to HTML/CSS. I've
            designed websites since the 2017s, and I always keep upgrading my
            skills. For now, I'd love to resolve people's issues through
            software, app.
